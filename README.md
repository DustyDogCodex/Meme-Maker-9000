Built using ReactJs

<a href="https://dustydogcodex.github.io/Meme-Maker-9000/">üî• LIVE DEMO üî•</a>

For this project, I built a meme generator using ReactJs. A user can click on a button to receive a random meme, selected from the 100 most popular memes from the imgflip API. The user can then add text on the top and bottom of the image to create a custom meme. 

me after I started learning React for the first time:
<div

    <img

        alt='forrest gump I am not a smart man'
        width='300' 
        height='300'    
    />
</div>

me when I built a React project that actually works:
<div align='center'>
    <img 
        src='https://tenor.com/view/james-franco-unsure-meaning-the-gif-20392074.gif'
        alt='forrest gump I am not a smart man'
        width='400' 
        height='300'    
    />
</div>

### Through this project I learnt to:

1. Use event listeners suing ReactJs.
2. Making API calls using useEffect() hook with React.
3. Create and work with forms in React :'(.
4. Use useState() to display user input on the dom without needing to constantly refresh the window or document.
5. Using conditional rendering to display/hide components based on specific conditions being satisfied.
