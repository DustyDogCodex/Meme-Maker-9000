Built using ReactJs

For this project, I built a meme generator using ReactJs. A user can click on a button to receive a random meme, selected from the 100 most popular memes from the imgflip API. The user can then add text on the top and bottom of the image to create a custom meme. 

Through this project I learnt to:

1. Use event listeners suing ReactJs.
2. Making API calls using useEffect() hook with React.
3. Create and work with forms in React :'( .
4. Use useState() to display user input on the dom without needing to constantly refresh the window or document.
5. Using conditional rendering to display/hide components based on specific conditions being satisfied.

Technical documentation:

To use the project on your local machine fork or clone this repo.

Then use 'npm start' to run the project on your local system.

Features to be added/future enhancements:

1. Allow more than 2 areas for adding text in multipanel memes.
2. Connect to a database to store and display custom community created certified fresh MeMes.
3. Allow users to create accounts to store memes they have created.
4. Allow users to save and download memes as png/jpeg files.
5. Allow users to share memes to different platforms like twitter etc.

Thanks for reading see you again soon!
